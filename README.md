## Projects

### 1. Deep Learning – Diffusion Models for Metasurface Prediction
- Implemented a **class-conditioned diffusion model (UNet, Hugging Face)** to predict metasurface patterns from light scattering data.  
- Dataset: 25,000 metasurface samples (Nano-Photonics Lab, TAU).  
- Results: The diffusion model successfully reconstructed metasurface patterns with high fidelity, achieving near-perfect metrics on the provided dataset.

### 2. Natural Language Processing – Two-Agent Framework for Multiple-Choice QA
- Developed a **two-agent framework** combining outputs of multiple LLMs for reasoning tasks.  
- Evaluated on **OpenBookQA** and **AI2 ARC** datasets with LLaMA and Qwen models.  
- Showed consistent improvements over baselines such as CoT and Self-Refine.

### 3. Mathematical Methods – Genetic Variation and Geographic Correlation
- Replicated the study *"Genes Mirror Geography within Europe"* using the **1000 Genomes Project dataset**.  
- Applied **PCA and regression** to explore correlations between genetic variation and geography.  
- Findings confirmed Finnish genetic isolation but weaker clustering for other populations.

### 4. Mapping and Perception for Autonomous Robots – Multi-Project Repository
- **Project 1:** Geodetic coordinates & occupancy grids (KITTI dataset).  
- **Project 2:** Kalman and Extended Kalman Filters for noisy GPS/IMU.  
- **Project 3:** EKF-SLAM and ICP for localization & mapping.  
- **Project 4:** Visual Odometry, 3D Object Detection (PointPillars), and Multi-Object Tracking (BoT-SORT).

# Certificate Projects (Bar-Ilan University)

1. Data Science Certificate – Product Demand Prediction for Inventory Management  
   - Conducted as part of the Bar-Ilan University **Data Science Certificate Program**.  
   - Analyzed online order data from a Indian restaurant, identifying frequent product baskets and predicting demand for the next three days.  
   - Applied Apriori algorithms for frequent itemset mining, feature engineering, and machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost).  
   - Results: AdaBoost achieved the best performance (Test AUC ≈ 0.80).  
   - Deliverables include a detailed PDF report and Colab notebooks.
